#Holds all the functions to calculate if a person drops out of a line or not

#BREAKDOWN
#For a given individual calculate the probability they dropout at this moment given the number of items infront of them

#INSTRUCTIONS FOR GERARD

#GIVEN A CUSTOMERS ENTER TIME, THE CURRENT TIME (FLOATS) AND THE NUMBER OF ITEMS INFRONT OF THEM GET THE PROBABILITY THEY DROPOUT
#HAVE A FUNCTION RANDOMLY CHOOSE IF THEY DROPOUT BASED ON THE PROBABILITY, RANDOM SAMPLING
